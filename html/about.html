                <h1>About the Property</h1>
                <p>The idea to transform the barn into a wedding and reception place came when Beryl's nephew, Ben, asked if
                    he could hold his wedding here. Five months after his engagement, what started as a 12-stall horse barn
                    is what you see today. Ben and Lauren (his wonderful wife!) put in their own sweat equity, and friends
                    and neighbors worked tirelessly until the big day to make sure the space looked perfect.

                    <p style="color:white">Beryl has lived in the log home on the property since 1989. In 1991, she opened a bed and breakfast on
                        site. She has helped host five weddings (prior to her nephew’s) on the grounds. Cast members from
                        two troupes of “Phantom of the Opera” have spent their leave here with her while performing in Nashville.
                        She has even hosted the Mississippi State lacrosse team on many occasions, as well as many rehearsal
                        dinners. With almost total flexibility, she wants to help you make this space what you want to be!
                        Every occasion here so far has been unique and memorable for all, and Beryl sincerely hopes that
                        good times and great memories are what everyone will continue to take away from her property.
